Using survey data gathered in Osh, Kyrgyzstan after the 2010 ethnic riots that included 1200 responses, this paper explored the question of whether exposure to ethnic riots has a negative effect on both in and out-group prosocial behavior. Their conclusion was that exposure to violence during this riot negatively affected prosocial behavior towards both the in and out-groups.

(2018) on mass shooting intervals looks at how the intervals have continued to changed since their publication. Specifically, the update uses the regressions created to compare the expected intervals in the past two years with the actual intervals. Visualizing the intervals between shootings is crucial information that could help identify if recent preventative measures have been effective at decreasing the number of mass shootings. It also provides insight for what still needs to be done and if further preventative measures need to be implemented."
