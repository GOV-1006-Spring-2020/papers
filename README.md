[Miroslav Bergam](https://github.com/mirobergam) --- ([repo](https://github.com/mirobergam/Replication-paper) [pdf](https://github.com/mirobergam/Replication-paper/blob/master/Bergam.pdf)) --- This is an extension of the research conducted by Adam Zelizer at The University of Chicago in 2019, which finds that the cues that state legislators take from their peers influences their policymaking decisions. The paper also concludes that that this influence is at play late in the policymaking process, as well as that these cues complement rather than substitute other sources of information.

[Maria Burzillo](https://github.com/mburzillo/) ---([repo](https://github.com/mburzillo/Final-Project-Final-Version))

[Evelyn Cai](https://github.com/caievelyn) --- ([repo](https://github.com/caievelyn/milestone/) [pdf](https://github.com/caievelyn/milestone/blob/master/milestone_6_half.pdf)) --- This extension of the research conducted by Yusaku Horiuchi, Daniel Smith, and Teppei Yamamoto (2020) looks at the gap between the experimental results and actual observational data of candidate attributes who were elected. The extension of the research involves comparing the average marginal component effects (AMCEs) to the marginal means, which were introduced by Leeper et al. (2019) as a more accurate way of comparing component effects without arbitrarily choosing baseline values. 

[Molly Chiang](https://github.com/mollyechiang) --- ([repo](https://github.com/mollyechiang/1006_milestone_6)) --- This is an extension of Marshall (2015), which shows the causal effect of additional years of schooling on voting conservative via regression discontinuty analysis on voting records of individuals before and after the British 1947 school-leaving age reform. This extension aims to see if the same effect is found in an analysis of a later education reform in England.

[Drake Deuel](https://github.com/ddeuel) --- ([repo](https://github.com/ddeuel/Bikeshare-Replication) [pdf](https://github.com/davidkane9/gov_1006_spring_2020_papers/papers/bikeshare_deuel.pdf)) --- "This is an extension and replication of the research done by Fullter et al. (2019) which used the Philadelphia's transit workers strike from November 1-7, 2016, to generate a natural experiment in which other means of transit were interrupted to study the impact on bikeshare ride usage."

[Debora Gonzalez](https://github.com/deboragonzalez) --- ([repo](https://github.com/deboragonzalez/Milestones) ([pdf] (https://github.com/GOV-1006-Spring-2020/papers/blob/master/papers/GonzalezDebi_Replication.pdf)) --- This is a replication and extension project of the "Local demographic changes and US presidential voting, 2012 to 2016" study by Seth J. Hilla, Daniel J. Hopkins, and Gregory A. Huberc, which explored how demographic changes from 2000 to 2016 affected the 2016 general election outcome. The topics of immigration and the increase of racial and ethnic minorities have been fairly prevalent in media, social media, and political rhetoric over the last few years, but do these phenomena actually influence voting behavior? This study analyzes voting patterns in areas that received an influx of immigrants prior to the 2016 general election. This document presents the working replication exercise of the afore-mentioned academic paper through a textual overview of the authors' findings and methods, a high-level visual presentation of the data, and a close-replication of the original analysis. It also contains an extension proposal, which will become the core of this project, as a form of critique, development, and/or expansion of the original findings.

[Suriya Kandaswamy](https://github.com/sardination/) --- ([repo](https://github.com/sardination/gov1006-final-project) [pdf](https://github.com/GOV-1006-Spring-2020/papers/blob/master/papers/Kandaswamy_Dynamic_responsiveness.pdf)) --- This is an extension of "Policy Preferences and Policy Change: Dynamic Responsiveness in the American States, 1936-2014" by Caughey and Warshaw (2018) which takes a look at the responsiveness of state policy liberalism to mass liberalism based on public opinion while taking into account legislative party control, geography, and other factors.

This extension of the research done by Pan (2017) on the signalling function of local government websites in China explores whether other explanations than the signalling function within authoritarian regimes may plosibly exlain the alterations in competence / benevolence patterns described in the paper. I will explore these alternatives by comparing the explanatory power of the variable categories employed in the paper and extending them with a new category (culture which will include the macro-region and the county type). Building on this, the other part of my extension will be around validating the sample selection process. It seems very surprising that the author has sub-selected 100 of the 2,787 counties with website, and we immediately dismiss another ~30 in our regressions because of data inavailability and subsequently another ~20 as our regressions get more ambitious and include more variables.

[Samuel Lowry](https://github.com/SamuelLowry) --- ([repo](https://github.com/SamuelLowry/why_friends_and_neighbors_replication_paper.git)) ([paper](https://github.com/SamuelLowry/why_friends_and_neighbors_replication_paper/blob/master/milestone-6.5.pdf)) --- This is an extension of Campbell et al. (2019) which details two separate experiments which suggest that individuals think of politicians with local roots and that exibit behavioral localism more highly. I was able to replicate the entire article with the exceptions of table 1 and figure 2 because they visuals relating to methodology and not the results themselves. I will be conducting an extension which includes the use of stan_glm instead of lm as well as look at certain subgroups based upon location and party identification. I hope to find cool things:)

[Diego Martinez](https://github.com/diegomartinez1221) --- ([repo](https://github.com/diegomartinez1221/gov_1006_replication)) This is an extension of "Why Friends and Neighbors? Explaining the Electoral Appeal of Local Roots" by Rosie Campbell, Philip Cowley, Nick Vivyan, Markus Wagner. They seek to understand why politicians with local roots have more successs by testing how this effect holds up when voters are treated with the candidate's behavioral information. They concluded that with more infomation, the local roots effect does diminish; however, it is still positve. Furthermore, voters had a marginally higher preference for candidates with local roots compared to other varying characterstics including gender, party, and policy interests.

The extension will test the model on data from electoral systems with similar party groupings as their training data (Canada) and radically different party groupings (India)."

[Alexandra Norris](https://github.com/asnorris) --- ([repo](https://github.com/asnorris/Replication_1006) --- [original paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0010414017730079) and [data verse](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0010414017730079) --- This paper is a replication of the work conducted by Ejdemyr et al. (2017): "Segregation, Ethnic Favoritism, and the Strategic Targeting of Local Public Goods"

[Cris Patvakanian](https://github.com/cpatvakanian) --- ([repo](https://github.com/cpatvakanian/milestone_6.5) [pdf](https://github.com/cpatvakanian/milestone_6.5/blob/master/milestone_6.5.pdf)) --- I am replicating “Vote Brokers, Clientelist Appeals, and Voter Turnout: Evidence from Russia and Venezuela” by Timothy Frye, Ora John Reuter and David Szakonyi. They analyze voting patterns and clientelism in Russia and Venezuela through the use of original survey data. They also run fixed effect linear regressions to see what influence the skewing of the voting turnout for a couple of different types of leverage, looking specific demographics of the type of individuals which are classified as brokers. This paper ultimately finds that in Russia and Venezuela, different types of brokers and methods can influence voter turnout differently, which seems to be expected. All analysis for this paper be found in the [original paper](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-politics/article/vote-brokers-clientelist-appeals-andvoter-turnout-evidence-from-russia-and-venezuela/45FE0BE1216FCD8744B02A82919B328A) and [data verse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/YSVMS2).


[Timothy Ravis](https://github.com/soetimno) --- ([repo](https://github.com/soetimno/ravis_1006_final_project.git) [pdf](https://github.com/GOV-1006-Spring-2020/papers/blob/master/papers/Tim_Ravis_Deforestation_and_Titling.pdf)) --- This is a replication and extension of Buntaine et al (2015) on the impact of land titling reforms for indigenous peoples in Ecuador on deforestation rates in those areas. Their analysis is done by combining government data on the locations of legalized plots of land with a range of geographical data, including remote sensing imagery. After matching treated plots with untreated ones, they find no significant treatment affect on deforestation rates. 

[Daniel Shapiro](https://github.com/dfshapir) --- ([repo](https://github.com/dfshapir/Replication) [pdf](https://github.com/dfshapir/Replication/blob/master/Shapiro_Chechnya.pdf)) --- This is an extension and replication of the paper "Laws In Conflict: Legacies of War, Gender, and Legal Pluralism in Chechnya" written by Egor Lazarev. The paper utilizes data collected by the author in the Russian regions of Chechnya and Ingushetia to analyze how various factors affected residents' choice of either Russian law courts, sharia courts, or customary (adat) arbitration in family-related cases. The author finds that women are significantly more likely to choose Russian state law than men, a finding that a) the author argues is unique to Chechnya due to the republic's violent recent history and b) I was able to replicate. My extension focuses on some of Lazarev's political and sociological analyses of Chechnya and Ingushetia and some of his data choices as well.

[Cian Stryker](https://github.com/CianStryker) --- ([repo](https://github.com/CianStryker/Prosocial_Behavior) [pdf](https://github.com/GOV-1006-Spring-2020/papers/blob/master/papers/Cian_Stryker_Prosocial_Behavior.pdf)) --- This is an extension and replication of the paper "Ethnic Riots and Prosocial Behavior: Evidence from Kyrgyzstan" written by Anselm Hager, Krzysztof Krakowski, and Max Schaub. Using survey data from Osh, Kyrgyzstan after the 2010 ethnic riots that includes 1200 responses, this paper explores the question of whether exposure to ethnic riots has a negative effect on both in and out-group prosocial behavior. Their conclusion was that exposure to violence during this riot negatively affected prosocial behavior towards both the in and out-groups.

[Abrar Trabulsi](https://github.com/abrartrabulsi) --- In her paper 'Exposure to inequality affects support for redistribution', Sands explores how exposure to inequality affects attitutdes towards redistribution efforts.

[Hannah Valencia](https://github.com/h-valencia) --- ([repo](https://github.com/h-valencia/Firearms-Replication) [pdf](https://github.com/h-valencia/Firearms-Replication/blob/master/FirearmsRepPaper.pdf)) --- Levine and McKnight (2017) show that in the 5-month period following the Sandy Hook school shooting in December 2012, a large spike in gun sales contributed to an increase in accidental firearm deaths.

[Kevin Wang](https://github.com/kevpwang) --- ([repo](https://github.com/kevpwang/replication_project)) --- Hopkins (2015) finds that exposing survey respondents to video of an immigrant with "culturally distinctive" traits causes the respondents to adopt more inclusive attitudes toward immigration. I successfully replicated Hopkins's results and extended his model to account for varying levels of preexisting Spanish exposure among respondents that might influence their responses to such traits.

(2018) on mass shooting intervals and looks at how the intervals have continued to changed since the publication. The authors were  looking at the time trend and associated risk factors for mass shootings, but their results regarding the time intervals will be the main focus in this project. Regarding intervals between mass shootings, the authors found that the interval has been decreasing in the past three decades with the rate of shootings increasing. Specifically, I will be using the regressions created in the paper to compare the expected intervals of shootings in the past two years with the actual intervals. Visualizing the intervals between shootings is crucial information that could help identify if recent preventative measures have been effective at decreasing the number of mass shootings. It also provides insight for what still needs to be done and if further preventative measures need to be implemented.

[Amanda Su](https://github.com/amanda-y-su) --- ([repo](https://github.com/amanda-y-su/race-writing-computation)) --- [pdf](https://github.com/GOV-1006-Spring-2020/papers/blob/master/papers/su_race_computation.pdf)) This is a replication and extension of the paper "Race, Writing, and Computation: Racial Difference and the US Novel, 1880-2000" writtten by Richard Jean So, Hoyt Long, and Yuancheng Zhu. The authors seek to explore how computation can present new opportunities for thinking about racial difference and its patterns and regularities at scale. They test if American novelists marked as “white” versus “black” produce different narratological effects with respect to the interaction of race and religious authority, in particular, the authority of the Bible. In simpler terms, do writers identified as racially different contextualize the Bible in different ways in their novels?
