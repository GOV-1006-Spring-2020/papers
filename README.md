[Maria Burzillo](https://github.com/mburzillo/) ---([repo](https://github.com/mburzillo/new_final_project)[ pdf](https://github.com/GOV-1006-Spring-2020/papers/blob/master/papers/Burzillo_residential_segregation.pdf)) - This is an extension of Jessica Trounstine's "Segregation and Inequality in Public Goods" (2016). I was able to replicate the main results of Trounstine's paper in R to suggest that racial segregation contributes to political polarization and decreased spending on public goods. Additionally, I extend the analysis by imputing missing data and rerunning Trounstine's original model as a robustness check. 


[Evelyn Cai](https://github.com/caievelyn) --- ([repo](https://github.com/caievelyn/milestone/) [pdf](https://github.com/caievelyn/milestone/blob/master/milestone_6.pdf)) --- This extension of the research conducted by Yusaku Horiuchi, Daniel Smith, and Teppei Yamamoto (2020) looks at the gap between the experimental results and actual observational data of candidate attributes who were elected.

[Molly Chiang](https://github.com/mollyechiang) --- ([repo](https://github.com/mollyechiang/1006_milestone_6) [pdf](https://github.com/mollyechiang/1006_milestone_6/blob/master/chiang_british_education_reform.pdf)) --- This is an extension of Marshall (2015), which shows the causal effect of additional years of schooling on voting conservative via regression discontinuty analysis on voting records of individuals before and after the British 1947 school-leaving age reform. This extension aims to see if the same effect is found in an analysis of a later education reform in England. 

[Ali Crump](https://github.com/alicrump) --- ([repo](https://github.com/alicrump/Fentanyl_Replication_Project) [pdf](https://github.com/alicrump/Fentanyl_Replication_Project/blob/master/milestone6.pdf)) --- This extension of the research done by Zoorob (2019) on the geography of the overdose epidemic aims to improve the two-stage least squares regression analysis by performing a TBD alternative strategy to analyze the instrumental variables.

[Drake Deuel](https://github.com/ddeuel) --- ([repo](https://github.com/ddeuel/Bikeshare-Replication) [pdf](https://github.com/davidkane9/gov_1006_spring_2020_papers/papers/bikeshare_deuel.pdf)) --- "This is an extension and replication of the research done by Fullter et al. (2019) which used the Philadelphia's transit workers strike from November 1-7, 2016, to generate a natural experiment in which other means of transit were interrupted to study the impact on bikeshare ride usage."

[Michelle Gao](https://github.com/michgao87) --- ([repo](https://github.com/michgao87/gov1006-replication) [pdf](https://github.com/GOV-1006-Spring-2020/papers/blob/master/papers/gao_tech_political_preferences.pdf)) --- This is an extension of "Predispositions and the Political Behavior of American Economic Elites: Evidence from Technology Entrepreneurs" by Broockman, Ferenstein, and Malhotra (2019). 

[Debora Gonzalez](https://github.com/deboragonzalez) --- ([repo](https://github.com/deboragonzalez/Milestones) --- This is a replication and extension project of the "Local demographic changes and US presidential voting, 2012 to 2016" study by Seth J. Hilla, Daniel J. Hopkins, and Gregory A. Huberc, which explored how demographic changes from 2000 to 2016 affected the 2016 general election outcome. The topics of immigration and the increase of racial and ethnic minorities have been fairly prevalent in media, social media, and political rhetoric over the last few years, but do these phenomena actually influence voting behavior? This study analyzes voting patterns in areas that received an influx of immigrants prior to the 2016 general election. This document presents the working replication exercise of the afore-mentioned academic paper through a textual overview of the authors' findings and methods, a high-level visual presentation of the data, and a close-replication of the original analysis. It also contains an extension proposal, which will become the core of this project, as a form of critique, development, and/or expansion of the original findings.

[PDF](https://github.com/carine-h/replication-project/blob/master/final_project_carine_hajjar.pdf)--- Barber and Pope (2018) show that the electorate is more influenced by party position than real ideology. The results of the paper and the replication indicate that party loyalists vote in line with their leader, regarless of the political content of their leader's cues. More specifically, voters with low political knowledge, high partisanship, and high approval of their leader are more likely to support their leader's cues, regardless of the true ideological implications, even if they are not in line with the party's traditional views. I looked at Barber and Pope's regressions testing the causal effect of conservative and liberal cues from President Trump on Republican, Democrats, and Independents with varying levels of political knowledge, partisanship, approval of Trump, and political ideology. I took the regression on partisanship and knowledge as well as the overall regression of average cue response among all political identities and ran a more robust binomial regression as well as corrected for a mistake in the first figure of the paper. I found that party loyalists are not necessarily ideological loyalists and, more specifically, that many Republican Trump supporters respond positively to liberal or conservative cues from Trump but not necessarily from others. This finding forces Americans to rethink the importance of parties and the ideological strength of their positions.

This extension of the research done by Pan (2017) on the signalling function of local government websites in China explores whether other explanations than the signalling function within authoritarian regimes may plosibly exlain the alterations in competence / benevolence patterns described in the paper. I will explore these alternatives by comparing the explanatory power of the variable categories employed in the paper and extending them with a new category (culture which will include the macro-region and the county type). Building on this, the other part of my extension will be around validating the sample selection process. It seems very surprising that the author has sub-selected 100 of the 2,787 counties with website, and we immediately dismiss another ~30 in our regressions because of data inavailability and subsequently another ~20 as our regressions get more ambitious and include more variables.

This is an extension of "Games Rivals Play: Terrorism in International Rivalries" by Michael Findley, James Piazza, and Joseph Young. This paper analyzes transnational terrorism as a component of interstate rivalries, specifically focusing on the use of terrorism in proxy warfighting. They find that interstate rivalries are a positive predictor of transnational terrorist activity. In other words, terrorist attacks are more likely to occur in the context of a rivalry between two states than in the absence of such a rivalry.

Explaining the Electoral Appeal of Local Roots" by Rosie Campbell, Philip Cowley, Nick Vivyan, Markus Wagner. They seek to understand why politicians with local roots have more successs by testing how this effect holds up when voters are treated with the candidate's behavioral information. They concluded that with more infomation, the local roots effect does diminish; however, it is still positve. Furthermore, voters had a marginally higher preference for candidates with local roots compared to other varying characterstics including gender, party, and policy interests. I was able to replicate all the results of their paper. For my extension, I modeled how local roots influence different sub-populations including male vs. female voters as well as different age groups.

[Robert McKenzie](https://github.com/rmckenzie11) --- ([repo](https://github.com/rmckenzie11/Replication_1006)) --- "This extension of research conducted by Ernesto Calvo and Jonathan Rodden (2015) on the relationship between geographic distribution and electoral representation in multi-party democracies, specifically the UK, tests the MC Model they built on different election datasets. The extension will test the model on data from electoral systems with similar party groupings as their training data (Canada) and radically different party groupings (India)."

[Prachi Naik](https://github.com/prachiknaik) --- 
([repo](https://github.com/prachiknaik/violent_protest_and_policy_change) [pdf](https://github.com/prachiknaik/violent_protest_and_policy_change/blob/master/Milestone_5.pdf)) --- This paper seeks to answer a longstanding question in political science: though violent protests are undoubtedly eye-catching and dramatic, do they actually have an effect on political behavior? Focusing on the 1992 LA "Race Riots" (also commonly called the "Rodney King Riots"), one of the most high profile events of political violence in recent years, Enos and his colleagues found that the riot caused a significant liberal shift in policy support at the polls for issues said to have motivated the riots themselves. Throughout the paper, the researchers use a difference-in-differences approach along with geocoded data analysis to investigate the source of this shift and trace it back to the mobilization of African American and Liberal White voters following the LA Riots. The "policy shifts" referenced here are actually local shifts in referendum voting on public goods targeted at urban dwelling racial minorities after the 1992 riots. These policies were put on the ballot before the riots erupted. Though the riot itself was a nonrandom event, the release of the video of police officers brutalizing an unarmed Black man (Rodney King) that ultimately triggered the riot was considered by the researchers to be unrelated to the election timeline. The researchers conducted a difference-in-difference analysis of pre and post riot policy voting to control for secular trends in policy support. They further explored the validity of this causal claim by examining the spatial correlation between how much support for a certain policy changed based on how far from the epicenter of those voters were. Ultimately, they found that the closer voters were to the epicenter of the riots, the more likely they were to vote for policies that provided liberal relief to minority urban communities.

[Daniel Shapiro](https://github.com/dfshapir) --- ([repo](https://github.com/dfshapir/Replication) [pdf](https://github.com/dfshapir/Replication/blob/master/Shapiro_Chechnya.pdf)) --- This is an extension and replication of the paper "Laws In Conflict: Legacies of War, Gender, and Legal Pluralism in Chechnya" written by Egor Lazarev. The paper utilizes data collected by the author in the Russian regions of Chechnya and Ingushetia to analyze how various factors affected residents' choice of either Russian law courts, sharia courts, or customary (adat) arbitration in family-related cases. The author finds that women are significantly more likely to choose Russian state law than men, a finding that a) the author argues is unique to Chechnya due to the republic's violent recent history and b) I was able to replicate. My extension focuses on some of Lazarev's political and sociological analyses of Chechnya and Ingushetia and some of his data choices as well.

[Cian Stryker](https://github.com/CianStryker) --- ([repo](https://github.com/CianStryker/Prosocial_Behavior) [pdf](https://github.com/GOV-1006-Spring-2020/papers/blob/master/papers/Cian_Stryker_Prosocial_Behavior.pdf)) --- This is an extension and replication of the paper "Ethnic Riots and Prosocial Behavior: Evidence from Kyrgyzstan" written by Anselm Hager, Krzysztof Krakowski, and Max Schaub. Using survey data from Osh, Kyrgyzstan after the 2010 ethnic riots that includes 1200 responses, this paper explores the question of whether exposure to ethnic riots has a negative effect on both in and out-group prosocial behavior. Their conclusion was that exposure to violence during this riot negatively affected prosocial behavior towards both the in and out-groups.

(2018) on mass shooting intervals looks at how the intervals have continued to changed since their publication. Specifically, the update uses the regressions created to compare the expected intervals in the past two years with the actual intervals. Visualizing the intervals between shootings is crucial information that could help identify if recent preventative measures have been effective at decreasing the number of mass shootings. It also provides insight for what still needs to be done and if further preventative measures need to be implemented.

[Amanda Su](https://github.com/amanda-y-su) --- This is a replication and extension of the paper "Race, Writing, and Computation: Racial Difference and the US Novel, 1880-2000" writtten by Richard Jean So, Hoyt Long, and Yuancheng Zhu. The authors seek to explore how computation can present new opportunities for thinking about racial difference and its patterns and regularities at scale. They test if American novelists marked as “white” versus “black” produce different narratological effects with respect to the interaction of race and religious authority, in particular, the authority of the Bible. In simpler terms, do writers identified as racially different contextualize the Bible in different ways in their novels? --- ([repo](https://github.com/amanda-y-su/race-writing-computation))
