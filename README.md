[Miroslav Bergam](https://github.com/mirobergam) --- ([repo](https://github.com/mirobergam/Replication-paper) [pdf](https://github.com/mirobergam/Replication-paper/blob/master/Bergam.pdf)) --- This is an extension of the research conducted by Adam Zelizer at The University of Chicago in 2019, which finds that the cues that state legislators take from their peers influences their policymaking decisions. The paper also concludes that that this influence is at play late in the policymaking process, as well as that these cues complement rather than substitute other sources of information.

[Maria Burzillo](https://github.com/mburzillo/) ---([repo](https://github.com/mburzillo/Final-Project-Final-Version))

[Evelyn Cai](https://github.com/caievelyn) --- ([repo](https://github.com/caievelyn/milestone/) [pdf](https://github.com/caievelyn/milestone/blob/master/milestone_6.pdf)) --- This extension of the research conducted by Yusaku Horiuchi, Daniel Smith, and Teppei Yamamoto (2020) looks at the gap between the experimental results and actual observational data of candidate attributes who were elected.

[Molly Chiang](https://github.com/mollyechiang) --- ([repo](https://github.com/mollyechiang/1006_milestone_6) [pdf](https://github.com/mollyechiang/replication/blob/master/chiang_edu_and_voting.pdf)) --- Marshall (2015) shows the causal effect of additional years of schooling on voting conservative in his analysis og voting records before and after the British 1947 school-leaving age reform. Marshall's figures and the results of his tables were replicated in Stata, but an update in the rdrobust package lead to my modification of his bandwidth selection code, and thus slightly different coefficients. In an extension of Marshall's work I investigated how his observed effect differed between genders. Running rdrobust and creating regression discontinuity figures on male and female subsets of the data revealed the effect of more years of education increasing likelihood of voting conservative was much stronger in women than men. This finding could complicate Marshall's argument that more education leads to higher income and then to more conservative political opinions and perhaps reveals something about the differing effect of education on men and women. 

[Ali Crump](https://github.com/alicrump) --- ([repo](https://github.com/alicrump/Fentanyl_Replication_Project)) --- [pdf](https://github.com/alicrump/Fentanyl_Replication_Project/blob/master/milestone7.pdf) --- Zoorob (2019) shows that geography and fentanyl exposure explain much of the variation in increased overdose mortality rates between 2011 and 2017. This paper succeeds in replicating all of the figures and tables in Zoorob’s research with the exception of Table 2B, the total estimated deaths attributable to fentanyl by each model. The estimates from table in the original publication more closely match official mortality statistics than the ones replicated in this paper. In addition to replicating Zoorob’s work, the extension of this paper aims to improve the two-stage least squares regression analysis by performing a TBD alternative strategy to analyze the instrumental variables. In my analysis I find X, which matters because Y.

[Drake Deuel](https://github.com/ddeuel) --- ([repo](https://github.com/ddeuel/Bikeshare-Replication) [pdf](https://github.com/davidkane9/gov_1006_spring_2020_papers/papers/bikeshare_deuel.pdf)) --- "This is an extension and replication of the research done by Fullter et al. (2019) which used the Philadelphia's transit workers strike from November 1-7, 2016, to generate a natural experiment in which other means of transit were interrupted to study the impact on bikeshare ride usage."

[Debora Gonzalez](https://github.com/deboragonzalez) --- ([repo](https://github.com/deboragonzalez/Milestones) --- 

[Suriya Kandaswamy](https://github.com/sardination/) --- ([repo](https://github.com/sardination/gov1006-final-project) [pdf](https://github.com/GOV-1006-Spring-2020/papers/blob/master/papers/Kandaswamy_Dynamic_responsiveness.pdf)) --- This is an extension of "Policy Preferences and Policy Change: Dynamic Responsiveness in the American States, 1936-2014" by Caughey and Warshaw (2018) which takes a look at the responsiveness of state policy liberalism to mass liberalism based on public opinion while taking into account legislative party control, geography, and other factors.

[Alexander Klueber](https://github.com/Alex1005-stack) ---

Pan (2017) shows that the emphasis on Chinese local government websites on either the competence or benevolence of county executives depends on where they are in the political tenure cycle. Early tenure county executives project images of benevolence by emphasizing their attentiveness and concern toward citizens. Late tenure executives project images of competence by highlighting their achievements. These findings shift the nature of debates concerning the role of the Internet in authoritarian regimes from a focus on regime-society interactions to an examination of dynamics among regime insiders. 

I was largely able to replicate the statistical models that the paper used to suggest the above relationships. My extension confirms that this is the most likely explanation for the observed effect by introducing a series of models that could support alternative explanations for the observed effect (e.g. cultural differences among regions, gender differences, etc.) and comparing the explanatory power of these models through the leave one out method. In addition I could validate the randomness of the sample selected to draw the underlying conclusions from a geographical perspective through a repeated sampling simulation and the construction of confidence intervals and their comparison with the observed provinces in the sample of 100 and the sample of 48 that was ultimately used to construct the models. This corraborates the findings of the paper by confirming the geographic randomness of the sample and the relative explanatory power of the model using political tenure cycle to explain website content.

[Chelsea Marlborough](https://github.com/chelseamarlborough) --- ([repo](https://github.com/chelseamarlborough/gov1006-finalpaper)), [pdf](https://github.com/chelseamarlborough/gov1006-finalpaper/blob/master/marlborough_final.pdf) Stokes (2015) finds that voters do pay attention to climate policy and afterwards penalize the incumbent governments for facilities viewed as harmful to the communities.

[Diego Martinez](https://github.com/diegomartinez1221) --- ([repo](https://github.com/diegomartinez1221/gov_1006_replication), [pdf](https://github.com/GOV-1006-Spring-2020/papers/blob/master/papers/Martinez_local_roots.pdf)) Campbell et al (2019) show that candidate's with shared local roots appeals to voters and that having local roots is an important factor in a voter's candidate selection. I was successfully able to replicate all the results presented in the orignal article "Why Friends and Neighbors? Explaining the Electoral Appeal of Local Roots." by Rosie Campbell, Philip Cowley, Nick Vivyan, Markus Wagner. To further their analysis, I modeled how local roots influence different sub-populations including males vs. females voters as well as between different age groups. I found the average marginal effect of local roots to not remain constant across subgroups, meaning local roots affect groups of voters differently. Thus, any further research regarding local roots effects should consider the gender as well as age makeup of the sample.  

[Meche, Beau](https://github.com/BeauMeche) --- 
([repo](https://github.com/BeauMeche/enforcement_distribution_electorate)
[pdf](https://github.com/BeauMeche/enforcement_distribution_electorate/blob/master/Meche_enforcement_variance.pdf)) --- "The Distributive Politics of Enforcement" by Alisha Holland (2014) analyzes electoral behavior's relationship with police action in opposition to low-income unlicensed street vendors in three cities in Latin America. 

[Robert McKenzie](https://github.com/rmckenzie11) --- ([repo](https://github.com/rmckenzie11/Replication_1006)[pdf](https://github.com/GOV-1006-Spring-2020/papers/blob/master/papers/McKenzie_Geography_Represenatation.pdf))) In "The Achilles Heel of Multiparty Democracies (2015)" Ernesto Calvo and Jonathan Rodden modelled the relationship between geographic distribution and electoral representation in multi-party democracies, specifically the UK. They test the MC Model they built on different election datasets. The extension will filter the UK election data to add another facet to ehir analyisis. 

[Alexandra Norris](https://github.com/asnorris) --- ([repo](https://github.com/asnorris/Replication_1006) --- [original paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0010414017730079) and [data verse](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0010414017730079) --- This paper is a replication of the work conducted by Ejdemyr et al. (2017): "Segregation, Ethnic Favoritism, and the Strategic Targeting of Local Public Goods".

[Cris Patvakanian](https://github.com/cpatvakanian) --- ([repo](https://github.com/cpatvakanian/milestone_6.5) [pdf](https://github.com/cpatvakanian/milestone_6.5/blob/master/milestone_6.5.pdf)) --- I am replicating “Vote Brokers, Clientelist Appeals, and Voter Turnout: Evidence from Russia and Venezuela” by Timothy Frye, Ora John Reuter and David Szakonyi. They analyze voting patterns and clientelism in Russia and Venezuela through the use of original survey data. They also run fixed effect linear regressions to see what influence the skewing of the voting turnout for a couple of different types of leverage, looking specific demographics of the type of individuals which are classified as brokers. This paper ultimately finds that in Russia and Venezuela, different types of brokers and methods can influence voter turnout differently, which seems to be expected. All analysis for this paper be found in the [original paper](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-politics/article/vote-brokers-clientelist-appeals-andvoter-turnout-evidence-from-russia-and-venezuela/45FE0BE1216FCD8744B02A82919B328A) and [data verse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/YSVMS2).

[Pieter Quinton](https://github.com/PGQuinton) ---  ([repo](https://github.com/PGQuinton/gov1006-finalproject-2.0), [pdf](https://github.com/GOV-1006-Spring-2020/papers/blob/master/papers/quinton_unemployment.pdf)) --- "Bauer (2018) finds that there is no consistent relationship between unemployment and one's trust in government and their satisfaction with democracy. I was able to completely replicate the majority of his findings aside from a summary table of the data. My extension evaluates how consistent or long-term unemployment may impact one's views. Rather than examining the effects of just a single year of unemployment, as Bauer did, I track unemployement trends over longer periods of time to see if extended periods of unemployment have a stronger impact on one's feelings towards the government and its institutions."

[Timothy Ravis](https://github.com/soetimno) --- ([repo](https://github.com/soetimno/ravis_1006_final_project.git) [pdf](https://github.com/GOV-1006-Spring-2020/papers/blob/master/papers/Tim_Ravis_Deforestation_and_Titling.pdf)) --- This is a replication and extension of Buntaine et al (2015) on the impact of land titling reforms for indigenous peoples in Ecuador on deforestation rates in those areas. Their analysis is done by combining government data on the locations of legalized plots of land with a range of geographical data, including remote sensing imagery. After matching treated plots with untreated ones, they find no significant treatment affect on deforestation rates. 

[Daniel Shapiro](https://github.com/dfshapir) --- ([repo](https://github.com/dfshapir/Replication) [pdf](https://github.com/dfshapir/Replication/blob/master/Shapiro_Chechnya.pdf)) --- This is an extension and replication of the paper "Laws In Conflict: Legacies of War, Gender, and Legal Pluralism in Chechnya" written by Egor Lazarev. The paper utilizes data collected by the author in the Russian regions of Chechnya and Ingushetia to analyze how various factors affected residents' choice of either Russian law courts, sharia courts, or customary (adat) arbitration in family-related cases. The author finds that women are significantly more likely to choose Russian state law than men, a finding that a) the author argues is unique to Chechnya due to the republic's violent recent history and b) I was able to replicate. My extension focuses on some of Lazarev's political and sociological analyses of Chechnya and Ingushetia and some of his data choices as well.

[Cian Stryker](https://github.com/CianStryker) --- ([repo](https://github.com/CianStryker/Prosocial_Behavior) [pdf](https://github.com/GOV-1006-Spring-2020/papers/blob/master/papers/Cian_Stryker_Prosocial_Behavior.pdf)) --- Hager, Krakowsi, and Schaub (2019) find that exposure to ethnic violence negatively affects prosocial behavior within and across ethnic groups. I was largely successful in replicating their main statistical models that demonstrate the negative effect the 2010 Osh, Kyrgyzstan ethnic riots had on prosocial behavior. My own extensions explore different confounders for the victimized ethnic group, the Uzbeks minority of Osh, and more intensely explore the effect of exposure to violence on the Kyrgyz, who are the dominant ethnic group. I found that for Kyrgyz exposed to violence during the riots, their prosocial behavior towards Uzbeks was partially positively affected by victimization, which is contradictory to the authors’ argument.  My results demonstrate that the effects of ethnic violence on prosocial behavior is not always entirely negative, which warrants further analysis.

[Amanda Su](https://github.com/amanda-y-su) --- ([repo](https://github.com/amanda-y-su/race-writing-computation) [pdf](https://github.com/GOV-1006-Spring-2020/papers/blob/master/papers/su_race_computation.pdf)) --- So, Long, and Zhu (2019) built a model that tests if novelists marked as “white” versus “black” produce different narratological effects with respect to the interaction of race and religious authority, in particular, the authority of the Bible. The study ultimately finds that when a white writer cites the Bible, it is less likely that she/he quotes it in a social context compared to when she/he writes about non-Bible related topics. However, when a black writer cites the Bible, it is more likely that she/he quotes it in a social context. I was able to successfully replicate the results of the authors' paper. For my extension, I decided to reconstruct the paper's primary model using a Bayesian approach. I found that the results of the model were largely the same the as that of the original. These robust results corroborate the author's conclusions about how race and writing intersect across more than a century of US fiction

[Abrar Trabulsi](https://github.com/abrartrabulsi) --- In her paper 'Exposure to inequality affects support for redistribution', Sands explores how exposure to inequality affects attitutdes towards redistribution efforts.

[Hannah Valencia](https://github.com/h-valencia) --- ([repo](https://github.com/h-valencia/Firearms-Replication) [pdf](https://github.com/h-valencia/Firearms-Replication/blob/master/FirearmsRepPaper.pdf)) --- Levine and McKnight (2017) show that in the 5-month period following the Sandy Hook school shooting in December 2012, a large spike in gun sales contributed to an increase in accidental firearm deaths. Their findings conclude that there was a spike in accidental firearm deaths resulting from the increase in exposure, which is confirmed in this replication. As an extension to this paper, the "post-Sandy Hook window" has been redefined from the 5-month period following the shooting to the 4-month period following. After changing this time period and running the regression again, the results found still hold, showing an increase in gun deaths following Sandy Hook. Even though the Sandy Hook shooting showed the need for stricter gun laws, the immediate aftermath of this realization led to the opposite effect as desired: more accidental firearm deaths.

[Kevin Wang](https://github.com/kevpwang) --- ([repo](https://github.com/kevpwang/replication_project)) --- Hopkins (2015) finds that exposing survey respondents to video of an immigrant with "culturally distinctive" traits causes the respondents to adopt more inclusive attitudes toward immigration. I successfully replicated Hopkins's results and extended his model to account for varying levels of preexisting Spanish exposure among respondents that might influence their responses to such traits.


[Yao Yu](https://github.com/itsyaoyu) --- ([repo](https://github.com/itsyaoyu/mass-shooting-intervals) [pdf](https://github.com/davidkane9/gov_1006_spring_2020_papers/papers/yu_mass_shooting_intervals.pdf)) --- Lin et al. (2018) found that the time interval between mass shootings has been drastic decreasing in the past three decades, suggesting that the rate of shootings are increasing. I managed to replicate most of the graphics from Lin et al. (2018) with the exception of table 1, where I was unable to recreate the exact zero-inflated poisson model. My extension broke down the interval trends between different venues of shootings showing in figure 2 of Lin et al. (2018). What I found was that the interval trend of mass school shootings remained relatively steady while the interval of mass workplace shootings drastically decreased and the overall interval also decreased. This finding suggests that the 2008 financial crisis might have played a major role in the decreasing interval of mass shootings.
