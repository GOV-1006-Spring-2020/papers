[Evelyn Cai](https://github.com/caievelyn) --- ([repo](https://github.com/caievelyn/milestone/) [pdf](https://github.com/caievelyn/milestone/blob/master/milestone_6.pdf)) --- This extension of the research conducted by Yusaku Horiuchi, Daniel Smith, and Teppei Yamamoto (2020) looks at the gap between the experimental results and actual observational data of candidate attributes who were elected.

[Drake Deuel](https://github.com/ddeuel) --- ([repo](https://github.com/ddeuel/Bikeshare-Replication) [pdf](https://github.com/davidkane9/gov_1006_spring_2020_papers/papers/bikeshare_deuel.pdf)) --- "This is an extension and replication of the research done by Fullter et al. (2019) which used the Philadelphia's transit workers strike from November 1-7, 2016, to generate a natural experiment in which other means of transit were interrupted to study the impact on bikeshare ride usage."

[Suriya Kandaswamy](https://github.com/sardination/) --- ([repo](https://github.com/sardination/gov1006-final-project) [pdf](https://github.com/davidkane9/gov_1006_spring_2020_papers/papers/Kandaswamy_Dynamic_responsiveness.pdf)) --- This is an extension of "Policy Preferences and Policy Change: Dynamic Responsiveness in the American States, 1936-2014" by Caughey and Warshaw (2018) which takes a look at the responsiveness of state policy liberalism to mass liberalism based on public opinion while taking into account legislative party control, geography, and other factors.

[Cian Stryker](https://github.com/CianStryker) --- ([repo](https://github.com/CianStryker/Prosocial_Behavior) [pdf](https://github.com/GOV-1006-Spring-2020/papers/blob/master/papers/Cian_Stryker_Prosocial_Behavior.pdf)) --- This is an extension and replication of the paper "Ethnic Riots and Prosocial Behavior: Evidence from Kyrgyzstan" written by Anselm Hager, Krzysztof Krakowski, and Max Schaub. Using survey data gathered in Osh, Kyrgyzstan after the 2010 ethnic riots that included 1200 responses, this paper explored the question of whether exposure to ethnic riots has a negative effect on both in and out-group prosocial behavior. Their conclusion was that exposure to violence during this riot negatively affected prosocial behavior towards both the in and out-groups.

[Yao Yu](https://github.com/itsyaoyu) --- ([repo](https://github.com/itsyaoyu/mass_shooting_intervals) [pdf](https://github.com/davidkane9/gov_1006_spring_2020_papers/papers/yu_mass_shooting_intervals.pdf)) --- "This extension of the research done by Lin et al. (2018) on mass shooting intervals looks at how the intervals have continued to changed since their publication. Specifically, the update uses the regressions created to compare the expected intervals in the past two years with the actual intervals. Visualizing the intervals between shootings is crucial information that could help identify if recent preventative measures have been effective at decreasing the number of mass shootings. It also provides insight for what still needs to be done and if further preventative measures need to be implemented."
